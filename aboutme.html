    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Name: Peter Delwita</h2>
    <p>
      I am a student at Staten Island Technical High School. My favorite foods
      are pizza and potato chips. I also like sugar and my dream vacation is to
      ShopRite.

      According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be
      able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the
      ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway, because it doesn't care what
      humans think are impossible.
